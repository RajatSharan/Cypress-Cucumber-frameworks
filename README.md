Cypress Automation with JavaScript and Cucumber
This repository hosts an automated testing framework built using Cypress and JavaScript, integrating Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD). This approach enables writing tests in a natural language style, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Project Overview
This project is designed to:

Automate end-to-end testing of web applications with Cypress.
Use Cucumber to write feature files in Gherkin syntax for easy readability.
Ensure maintainable and reusable test scripts.
Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing and delivery.
Key Features
Cypress Framework:

Supports fast and reliable testing for modern web applications.
Provides built-in support for assertions, mocking, and debugging.
Cucumber BDD Integration:

Feature files written in Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then).
Separation of test logic and test steps for maintainability.
Test Reporting and Debugging:

Generates detailed HTML reports with test results.
Captures screenshots and videos on test failure for debugging.
Continuous Integration:

Configured for CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) to run tests on every commit.
